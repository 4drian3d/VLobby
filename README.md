## Commands

In VLobby there are 2 CommandHandlers

### REGULAR
It is the default operation of VLobby, you can set as many commands as you want to teleport to a group of Lobby servers (or to a single Lobby if you have only one Lobby).

### COMMAND_TO_SERVER
With this CommandHandler you can teleport to any server using its name as command.
For example, to teleport to the `survival` server, you would require the `vlobby.command.survival` permission and you would use the `/survival` command
